# it's exactly the position where old comments.html file was placed i 1.0.5
comments : true -> inc_after_content : "path_of_comments_file.html"

# to add custom elements in <head> now you can use inc_after_head or inc_before_head to add
# your code
custom_head: true ->  inc_after_head : "path_of_head_file.html"

# custom sidebar can be added directly in <header> 
# via a custom file using inc_after_header
custom_sidebar: true -> inc_after_header : "path_of_sidebar_file.html" 

# if you need custom footer elements you can use inc_before_footer configuration now
